<h1 data-number="1" id="introduction"><span
class="header-section-number">1</span> Introduction</h1>
<p>Professional studio-based audio mixing of recorded material is an
innately collaborative process. Rarely is the audio engineer granted
carte blanche to produce a mix without some degree of oversight and
input from the various stakeholders, including the recording artist(s),
music producer(s), recording label representative(s) and, in the case of
music for film and television, the composer, music supervisor, editor,
producer(s) and director. Today, many modern music production studios
centrally integrate a Digital Audio Workstation (DAW) software
application in professional audio mixing. Although professional audio
mixing with all stakeholders physically in the well-equipped studio with
a DAW and audio engineer is ideal, remote collaboration modes and
practices for professional audio mixing are highly desirable, especially
in coronavirus-impacted times of self-isolation and travel restrictions.
This study’s <em>raison d’être</em> was to understand the current
practices and identify the requirements for an ideal remote
collaborative environment for professional audio mixing and
post-production. We conducted a series of semi-structured interviews
with professional audio mixing and music production engineers to answer
this central research question.</p>
<p>This article presents an interpretative phenomenological analysis
(IPA) of the responses from the semi-structured interviews. The IPA
approach, as defined by Smith (2004), is: ideographic, characterised by
a detailed sequential examination of each case in a small sample size;
inductive, “to allow unanticipated topics or themes to emerge during
analysis” (p. 43); and interrogative, where discussion of the results of
the analysis concerns the research project’s context. The interviews
were voluntary and aimed to ascertain several viewpoints, including:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>The prevailing use of DAW platforms in audio mixing and music
production workflows;</p></li>
<li><p>The range of specific DAW platforms used in the
industry;</p></li>
<li><p>Typical professional work-case scenarios;</p></li>
<li><p>The current use of keyboard shortcuts and control surfaces in
typical work-case scenarios;</p></li>
<li><p>Use of DAW-integrated online collaboration tools in professional
studio work;</p></li>
<li><p>Typical existing practices when working with remote
clients/colleagues;</p></li>
<li><p>Industry expectations of a real-time online audio mixing and
music production environment; and</p></li>
<li><p>The perceived utility of multiparty audio mixing and music
production online collaboration.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Six questions served as the interview guide and discussion starting
points and appear in the Appendix. As such, this article’s structure
consists of six discrete sections that inductively analyse the responses
to the interview questions and any related follow-up questions, followed
by a Discussion section.</p>

<h2 data-number="2.1" id="daw-platforms-and-their-typical-use"><span
class="header-section-number">2.1</span> DAW Platforms and Their Typical
Use</h2>
<p>Question 1 firstly concentrated on the participants’ choice of DAW
platform(s) to determine the technical sophistication and audio
processing capability required of a DAW engaged in professional audio
mixing. This question also sought to establish the participants’ typical
work-case scenarios and the role their DAW platform(s) played in
performing such work to achieve industry-standard results.</p>
<h3 data-number="2.1.1" id="the-prevailing-use-of-daw-platforms"><span
class="header-section-number">2.1.1</span> The Prevailing Use of DAW
Platforms</h3>
<p>In all nine instances, the engineers’ choice of DAW platform was
integral to their daily work. This sample size determined that most
studio configurations appeared to be an amalgamation of digital and
analogue technologies, with the DAW application serving as a centralised
input and output interface. There also appeared to be a differentiation
in the studio equipment used between recording and post-recording mixing
activities. Two participants, in particular, discussed mixing
“in-the-box”, indicating a predominant use of insert and send software
plug-ins to perform signal and effects processing, which, in essence,
utilises a purely digital environment:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“Just about all of my work is done on Pro Tools, and just about all
of it is done in-the-box.” -ME05</p>
<p>“But so much work is in-the-box these days, that you’d want to use
plug-ins you’re used to using.” -ME06</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Two participants also talked specifically about their use of external
hardware processing units, in particular, explaining that their DAW use
employs a hybrid digital/analogue signal-processing configuration.
Interestingly, ME05 stated that engaging such external hardware is done
during the recording, rather than post-production mixing, phase of music
production:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“When it comes to recording, though, I do use some of the outboard
gear I’ve got here in the studio, like the [Empirical Labs] Distressor
[compressor] and… the [Universal Audio] 1176 [limiting amplifier]. I
always use a preamp on the vocal mics just to warm them up a bit and
just print them straight to Pro Tools along with a clean dupe track.”
-ME05</p>
<p>“I think doing freelance jobs; you need to be across which plug-ins
will do the job if there’s no hardware, but, um, also you need, um, need
to be across at least the usual outboard gear, you know, like a
[Universal Audio] 1176 [limiting amplifier] or a [AMS Neve] 1073 [preamp
and EQ].” -ME07</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Several participants discussed employing their DAW for its sequencing
or programming capability, incorporating that aspect of automated music
production, and in particular, their use of virtual instrument plug-in
software:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“Apple Loops [utility in Logic Pro] is amazing for quickly getting
ideas down.” -ME01</p>
<p>“In terms of MIDI, if it’s a band thing, I’m happy to use MIDI stuff
as well. I personally here try to use real instruments where I can.
Depending on budget… I might use [inMusic Brands’] BFD [virtual drum
software] … and trigger them in…. I try and get real strings in where I
can, but … I use one, [IK Multimedia’s] SampleTank 3 [sample-based sound
workstation].” -ME02</p>
<p>“For a long time, I used Cubase as a sequencer, on occasion
supplementing the MIDI tracks with some audio tracks, then mixing down
to a stereo master audio track. Today, I’d say predominantly my
production activities are… a pretty even blend of MIDI, external
instrument tracks, VST instrument tracks and live audio tracks in the
one project.” -ME06</p>
<p>“Logic made more sense [because] a lot of what I do is
sequencer-based.” -ME08</p>
</blockquote>
<h3 data-number="2.1.2" id="the-range-of-daw-platforms"><span
class="header-section-number">2.1.2</span> The Range of DAW
Platforms</h3>
<p>All told, the participants mentioned a total of nine DAW platforms,
with six used in their typical audio engineering and mixing work:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><p>BandLab Technologies’ <em>BandLab</em>* (BandLab Technologies,
2021);</p></li>
<li><p>Steinberg’s <em>Cubase Pro</em> (Steinberg Media Technologies
GmbH, 2021a);</p></li>
<li><p>Mark of the Unicorn’s (MOTU’s) <em>Digital Performer</em> (Mark
of the Unicorn Inc., 2021);</p></li>
<li><p>Apple’s <em>GarageBand</em>* (Apple Inc., 2021a);</p></li>
<li><p>Ableton’s <em>Live</em>* (Ableton AG, n.d.);</p></li>
<li><p>Apple’s <em>Logic Pro</em> (Apple Inc., 2021c)</p></li>
<li><p>Avid’s <em>Pro Tools</em> (Avid Technology Inc., 2021);</p></li>
<li><p>Cockos’ <em>REAPER</em> (Cockos Inc., 2021); and</p></li>
<li><p>Waves’ <em>Tracks Live</em> (Waves Audio Ltd., 2021).</p></li>
</ol>
<p>* DAWs mentioned but not used by the participants.</p>
<p>One of the DAW platforms mentioned but not used by two participants
was <em>BandLab</em> (BandLab Technologies, 2021), the only web
browser-based DAW application of the nine DAW platforms. Both
participants recognised <em>BandLab</em> as being a platform capable of
facilitating online collaboration; however, neither expressed an
interest in using it for collaborative purposes:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“BandLab… I wouldn’t want to even try making a professional mix with
those online DAWs; it would drive me crazy. It needs to be… a proper
industry DAW like Pro Tools.” -ME07</p>
<p>“There is an online DAW out there called BandLab, which… I wouldn’t
want to use it for the sake of working with someone online.” -ME09</p>
</blockquote>
<p>While the browser-based user environment and cloud storage are
well-suited to online collaboration, the responses suggest that
browser-based DAWs such as BandLab, Spotify’s Soundtrap (Spotify USA /
Spotify AB, 2021), AmpTrack Technologies’ Amped Studio (AmpTrack
Technologies AB, 2021) and Audiotool (Audiotool.com, 2021), are yet to
see mainstream acceptance in professional mixing of recorded music.
While not explicitly discussed in the interviews, this eschewing of
browser-based DAWs could be due to their incompatibility with existing
VST-, AU- and AAX-based plug-ins. Furthermore, while developer efforts
have resulted in progressive improvements to input and output latencies
(wac2017 qmul, 2017), the Web Audio API, upon which these DAWs are
constructed, cannot provide the same low-latency response as that seen
in the long-established Audio Stream Input/Output (ASIO) (Steinberg
Media Technologies GmbH, 2020) or Core Audio (Apple Inc., 2017)
protocols.</p>
<p>Interestingly, several engineers mentioned utilising at least two DAW
applications depending on the type of work:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“So, I use two different systems; I use Logic Pro X for all my
writing, production, and quite a bit of mixing as well. But, for any
post-production stuff that I do, it’s all Pro Tools because every time I
try and mix a film project in Logic, [there are] problems.” -ME01</p>
<p>“Most often, the stuff that I would use, being live, … I use Waves
Tracks Live, or I use REAPER, … just because the primary function that
I’m looking for is rock-solid, reliable… recording of large files and
long times… and large track count… if we’re doing some mixdown stuff, it
would either be… Digital Performer or… Logic and the occasional Pro
Tools, but not as much.” -ME03</p>
<p>“I predominantly use Pro Tools… I also run Logic. Pro Tools is my
main thing for the last 12 years… I mix in that; I produce in that; I
record in that. Logic I’ve used probably the last six years. That is
more a writing tool for me.” -ME04</p>
<p>“Just about all of my work is done on Pro Tools… occasionally, I’ll
use Logic if there’s some programming needed… like… a synth pad or loop
thing, but all of that ends up as tracks in Pro Tools anyway.” -ME05</p>
</blockquote>
<p>From the data, it appears that some audio engineers consider <em>Pro
Tools</em>, for instance, as a DAW platform valued for its audio
recording and mixing capability but prefer <em>Logic Pro</em> for
sequenced content. There also appears to be different performance
requirements of a DAW platform between studio and live environments.
Both engineers who perform live recordings favour a DAW platform known
for its reliability but is not necessarily as sophisticated as those
employed in the studio environment. ME03 stated that the choice of using
<em>Tracks Live</em> or <em>REAPER</em> for live work is because
“<em>those platforms are arguably the most stripped-down, featureless,
boring set-ups around, but that’s why I use them</em>.”</p>
<p>Nevertheless, <em>Pro Tools</em> was the most used and referred to
DAW platform in the sample, exclusively utilised by two participants and
in conjunction with another DAW platform by another three participants.
Notably, all nine participants mentioned <em>Pro Tools</em> at least
once in their interviews, suggesting it is considered the most prevalent
DAW of the music industry and the proverbial yardstick to measure the
performance and features of other DAW platforms. Intriguingly, however,
three of the five <em>Pro Tools</em> users also employ another DAW
platform, mainly to compensate for what appears to be an apparent
weakness in sequencing/programming capability and ease of use:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“Mixing quickly when you’ve got to get stuff done, I find [Logic]
much faster than Pro Tools.” -ME01</p>
<p>“So, I found Logic sometimes to be quicker to write in than Pro
Tools, just because the virtual instruments are… all built into it.”
-ME04</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Figure 1 presents the breakdown of the choice of DAWs across the nine
participants.</p>

<figcaption aria-hidden="true">The choice of DAW platform(s) per
participant</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>However, analysing the data further and concentrating on which DAW
platform is exclusively, or predominantly, used for studio-based
post-production audio mixing, <em>Pro Tools</em> is the DAW of choice
for five participants, <em>Cubase Pro</em> for two and <em>Logic
Pro</em> for one. ME03, who stated that when “doing some mixdown stuff,
it would either be… <em>Digital Performer</em> or… <em>Logic</em> and
the occasional <em>Pro Tools</em>, but not as much”, did not
differentiate between <em>Digital Performer</em> and <em>Logic Pro</em>.
Therefore, they have been attributed to the participant, but with a 50%
weighting. Figure 2 shows this distribution of DAW platforms for
studio-based audio mixing.</p>

<h3 data-number="2.1.3" id="typical-daw-work-case-scenarios"><span
class="header-section-number">2.1.3</span> Typical DAW Work-Case
Scenarios</h3>
<p>The participants discussed three discrete music production
activities, for which their chosen DAW platform(s) played an integral
role:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><p>Studio-based audio recording;</p></li>
<li><p>Studio-based post-production audio mixing; and</p></li>
<li><p>Live multitrack audio recording.</p></li>
</ol>
<p>The audio material requiring post-production mixing was sourced
mainly from either studio recording sessions conducted by the
participant or from clients with audio files recorded elsewhere. In
addition to these activities, ME01 discussed post-production audio
mixing for film by importing video and specific DAW export file formats
into a <em>Pro Tools</em> session:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“They send me film, and they also send me an AAF [Advanced Authoring
Format file] or an OMF [Open Media Framework file], which is out of
their editing [software] … It has volume, gain clip… sometimes it has
panning… but the main thing is all the audio is locked in with the film,
and it’s very… frame-accurate.” -ME01</p>
</blockquote>
<p>However, mixing for this medium appears to be a specialised practice
considering only one of the nine participants mentioned this facet of
post-production audio mixing. Furthermore, the two live mixing engineers
discussed their DAW use for capturing live multitrack performances for
later post-production audio mixing:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“If you can imagine a live show that I’ve multitracked, the idea is
that those tracks be turned into something that will be commercially
released as a record, or… B-Sides or DVD.” -ME03</p>
<p>“Anyway, that’s what I do, studio recording and post mixes, and live
front-of-house mixing…, desk recordings and post-production.” -ME09</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Though not expressly mentioned, the engineers presumably export their
multitrack recordings as audio stems for importing into the DAW platform
better suited for such work than the one employed to capture the
recordings.</p>
<p>Interestingly, some of the participants, who engage in
post-production audio mixing of source material recorded outside of the
participants’ studios, expressed a reluctance or apprehension when
approaching this type of music production work:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“Yeah, I… do a little bit of that, but most of the stuff I record
here. I just want to hear [the recorded material] first because
oftentimes I find people’s expectations if they’ve recorded at home and
it’s… terribly recorded… they think that sending it to me it’s going to
sound like a Foo Fighters album or something, which is obviously not the
case. -ME02</p>
<p>“The bulk of my work is recording and post mixing. I have done just
some post mixing of tracks produced elsewhere, but… I prefer not to work
that way…. I don’t mix a lot of other people’s studio work… it’s a
challenge when I do, which I suppose is not that bad, but it takes more
time that I don’t always have or could be better spent doing other
work.” -ME05</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Conversely, ME07, who works as a freelance audio mixing engineer,
specialises in mixing recordings produced by other audio engineers, and
ME08 expressed enjoyment in such mixing work:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“As for the type of work I do, it’s pretty much freelance
post-production mixing.” -ME07</p>
<p>“I occasionally get some post-production work thrown my way, which I
really enjoy actually.” -ME08</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Given such divergent responses, it appears that whether a mixing
engineer works with audio they did not record or not comes down to a
personal preference.</p>
<h2 data-number="2.2"
id="prevailing-use-of-keyboard-shortcuts-and-control-surfaces"><span
class="header-section-number">2.2</span> Prevailing Use of Keyboard
Shortcuts and Control Surfaces</h2>
<p>This question queried the participants using two existing methods of
remotely operating a DAW application: keyboard shortcuts and control
surfaces. The reasoning for this particular line of inquiry was to
establish if using such methods was inherent in the participants’
established work routines.</p>
<p>All nine participants emphasised their use of keyboard shortcuts as
being integral to their workflow, attributing the expediency their usage
provides:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“Keyboard shortcuts, for anyone who has been producing for a while,
are like the”golden child” in every studio. Everyone has their own ones,
and they save you so much time.” -ME01</p>
<p>“I use the shortcuts; if… there’s something that I’m doing… in Pro
Tools, I’m like, ‘That could be a lot faster’, then I’ll look for a
shortcut. Most of the things that I need I have shortcuts.” -ME02</p>
<p>“I use keyboard shortcuts all the time; in fact, I can’t imagine how
I worked before them. The more I don’t have to touch the mouse, the more
I don’t have to take time finding some command in a menu, the better.”
-ME05</p>
<p>“Keyboard shortcuts streamline my workflow and makes setting up a
project so much quicker than using a mouse.” -ME06</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Six participants mentioned they had integrated a control surface
configuration into their extended DAW architecture. The reasons given
for why the participants included the use of a control surface into
their workflow were twofold: for the tactile operation when automating
DAW-specific events, and for the perceived superiority and ease compared
to using a mouse:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“When you’re automating something by [a mouse], it’s a lot different
to when you’re moving it by feel, by your hands. So, I think [there are]
definitely advantages to [control surfaces], and… when I’m mixing a song
and doing something creative, I’ll use faders.” -ME01</p>
<p>“Maybe it’s just that I came up from the old-school of physical
consoles: knobs, buttons, switches and faders. That is definitely my
comfort level… the world of automation… roughing things in if you like….
I always prefer to have something that reflects [my hands] rather than a
mouse.” -ME03</p>
<p>“Right now, I use the [Avid] S3, and I don’t know how I got on
without it… it has all the control I need right there, and I find myself
looking less and less at the mixer on-screen…. I really like the feel of
faders under my fingers. It makes me feel like I’m still keeping in
touch with what mixing has always been about: … things you can touch and
move while you listen.” -ME05</p>
<p>“I’ve also been using a Mackie MCU and MCU Extender control surface
set-up for the past 5 or 6 years…. I like the… tactile response I get
from real faders and rotary encoders when I’m mixing.” -ME06</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Interestingly, at the time of the interviews, some of the
participants who did not employ a control surface expressed a desire to
do so in the future, suggesting that such devices, and their use in
audio mixing activities, are becoming <em>de rigueur</em>.</p>
<h2 data-number="2.3"
id="experience-with-existing-daw-integrated-collaboration-features"><span
class="header-section-number">2.3</span> Experience with Existing
DAW-Integrated Collaboration Features</h2>
<p>Of the nine participants interviewed, seven worked with DAW platforms
that feature integrated online collaboration features. <em>Pro
Tools</em> users can access the asynchronous file and project sharing
feature, <em>Cloud Collaboration</em>. In contrast, the <em>Cubase
Pro</em> users have two collaborative options, the synchronous remote
performer recording system, <em>VST Connect</em>, and the asynchronous
file and project sharing approach facilitated by <em>VST Transit</em>.
Given that these seven participants had a readily available means of
online collaboration provided by their DAW platform, it was helpful
asking them about their level of familiarity and practical experience
with these two forms of collaboration to determine their current degree
of engagement in such activities.</p>
<h3 data-number="2.3.1" id="avids-pro-tools-cloud-collaboration"><span
class="header-section-number">2.3.1</span> Avid’s Pro Tools: Cloud
Collaboration</h3>
<p>Of the five participants who used <em>Pro Tools</em> for their
post-production audio mixing work, four said they had not used <em>Cloud
Collaboration</em>, and even then, the one participant who had, ME04,
had only tried it once. Furthermore, ME07 was not particularly aware of
its existence:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“I haven’t used it at all. It… vaguely sounds… familiar, you know, I
may have read something or heard someone… I really can’t imagine why I’d
use it, to be honest.” -ME07</p>
</blockquote>
<p>As to why the four participants who were familiar with <em>Cloud
Collaboration</em> chose not to use it, their responses derived several
themes:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>A reluctance to share the <em>Pro Tools</em> project file lest a
collaborator makes unwanted and permanent changes. As an aside,
<em>Cloud Collaboration</em> has track ownership and automatic version
saving mechanisms that can potentially circumvent such issues,
suggesting that despite the participant’s awareness of <em>Cloud
Collaboration</em>, there are aspects of its workflow that are not fully
understood:</p>
<ul>
<li><em>“It’s definitely something I’m interested in, and I can see it
being… a great thing in the future, but… the problem is it relies on
everyone having the same set-up and no one screwing the files up, and
they’re two things I’m very precious about.” -ME01</em></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p><em>Cloud Collaboration’s</em> practice of file sharing through
cloud storage is a collaboration method already exploited by the
practitioners through existing third-party cloud storage platforms:</p>
<ul>
<li><p><em>“My other thing with it, you only get that 1 GB of storage
unless you pay for more… I’ve already paid for enough subscriptions with
Dropbox.” -ME04</em></p></li>
<li><p><em>“I haven’t used it cause it’s so similar to what I already
do. Seriously, the only difference I could see from… what I usually do
using Dropbox is saving a bit of time importing changes directly into
Pro Tools.” -ME05</em></p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>Despite employing lossless file compression to maximise cloud
storage, users will typically require increased storage capacity the
more projects they choose to share in this fashion. However, with
increased storage comes increased cost, an imposition some of the
participants were unwilling to bear, as seen in ME04’s comment above for
instance:</p>
<ul>
<li><p><em>“If you want to pay for the Pro Tools subscription, you pay
for that and… I don’t want to pay more money… for something that works,
but it only works for Pro Tools.” -ME04</em></p></li>
<li><p><em>“The more you use it, the more storage space you need, and
they’re asking for another $300 US for the privilege. That difference
isn’t worth $400 a year when I already pay a yearly Dropbox subscription
that essentially does the same thing.” -ME05</em></p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>ME02 provided a different perspective on the theme of an
additional cost. Owing to the choice of hardware, also produced by Avid,
that integrates with <em>Pro Tools</em>, the participant operates an
earlier version of <em>Pro Tools</em>, as later versions are
incompatible with the hardware without additional expense. However, the
version the participant uses does not feature <em>Cloud
Collaboration.</em> As ME02 describes the dilemma:</p>
<ul>
<li>“[With] <em>my HD Native Thunderbolt</em> [interface]<em>, for me to
upgrade to the latest version of Pro Tools… Avid wanted something like…
around $900 US or something in that vicinity for the driver. It’s
something I’ve already paid like $8000 for… I don’t see why I should
have to pay that much money.” -ME02</em></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>ME04 also discussed a prerequisite for this collaboration model
with other colleagues: each person requires <em>Pro Tools</em>. However,
as the participant pointed out, this prerequisite cannot be taken for
granted:</p>
<ul>
<li><em>“I work with a lot of artists, especially recently</em> [who
are] <em>running Ableton or running Logic or running GarageBand for Mac.
You can’t tell them to go get Pro Tools just to do a</em>
[collaboration] <em>session.” -ME04</em></li>
</ul></li>
</ul>

Connect and VST Transit</h3>
<h4 data-number="2.3.2.1" id="vst-connect"><span
class="header-section-number">2.3.2.1</span> VST Connect</h4>
<p>Both participants who chose to utilise Cubase Pro for their
studio-based audio mixing also employed <em>VST Connect</em> for its
real-time remote performer recording capability. ME06 and ME09 noted the
importance of an accessible high-speed Internet connection, something
that, in Australia, has only been available since the mid-2010s
(Gregory, 2019):</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“The first time I did use [VST Connect] was to record a guitarist…
[in] 2014 or 15… using VST Connect SE… and it didn’t work all that well.
There were just too many dropouts for any of it to be useful. I did
revisit it, though, when I got… a 50 Mbps connection and… the Pro
version of VST Connect…. This time I used it to record vocals, and it
worked really well.” -ME06</p>
<p>“When Steinberg came out with Connect Pro… I was sceptical… It wasn’t
till I got [high-speed broadband] connected that I investigated it a
little more, and I was… really surprised at the automatic
configuration.” -ME09</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Both participants acknowledged that they still encounter sporadic
jitter and audio dropouts with the performer’s streamed audio; however,
the Pro version of <em>VST Connect</em> provides post-session
transmission of a high-resolution audio recording of the performer,
stored on the performer’s computer, which automatically replaces the
streamed audio in the <em>Cubase Pro</em> project. The participants
pointed to this functionality as a highly-valued feature:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“I also got the Pro version of VST Connect, even though it cost me to
do it, mainly because [it] could let you transfer a high-quality
recording of the performer to replace the live-streamed version after
the recording session.” -ME06</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The participants mentioned <em>VST Connect’</em>s video communication
as a positive way to interact with the remote performer, distinguishing
it from other similar collaboration platforms:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“The video is great, too; I didn’t have that with [an alternative
remote recording platform]. Yeah, it’s a really useful add-on to have.”
-ME09</p>
</blockquote>
<h4 data-number="2.3.2.2" id="vst-transit"><span
class="header-section-number">2.3.2.2</span> VST Transit</h4>
<p>In stark contrast to the participants’ uptake of <em>VST
Connect</em>, neither of them chose to use the <em>VST Transit</em>
method of collaboration, mirroring the response received by those
participants who utilise <em>Pro Tools</em>. Again, the dominant reason
behind their decision owes to the similarity in functionality with the
participants’ existing remote collaboration practices co-opting existing
third-party cloud storage solutions and the extra cost of additional
storage capacity:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“With VST Transit, I’ve also checked it out, but it’s really similar
to just using Dropbox to share your files…. I guess it’s another way for
people to connect, but it’s not something I really need considering I’m
already paying for a Dropbox subscription.” -ME06</p>
<p>“[VST Transit is] just another cloud storage and sharing thing that I
do already using Dropbox or Google Drive. I don’t really need to share
my recordings with anyone; I just send a mix.” -ME09</p>
</blockquote>
<p>ME09 identified a similar issue with <em>Pro Tools</em> and <em>Cloud
Collaboration</em>, in that collaborating with <em>VST Transit</em>
requires the other collaborators also to have a recent version of
<em>Cubase Pro</em> to access the project and audio files:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“From what I can tell, [VST Transit is] a way to share your Cubase
projects, and I don’t know too many other people also using Cubase,
which, um, kind of makes it unnecessary, really.” -ME09</p>
</blockquote>
<p>However, <em>VST Transit Join</em> (Steinberg Media Technologies
GmbH, 2021b) is a more recent add-on to <em>VST Transit</em> that allows
collaborators with DAW platforms other than <em>Cubase Pro</em> to
access and contribute to the shared <em>Cubase Pro</em> project.</p>
<h2 data-number="2.4" id="existing-remote-collaboration-practices"><span
class="header-section-number">2.4</span> Existing Remote Collaboration
Practices</h2>
<p>Aside from the two instances of remote recording collaboration, as
already alluded to in the previous section, those participants who
engage in collaboration practices with (mainly) clients outside of the
studio environment do so in an asynchronous, file sharing environment
employing third-party free or subscription cloud storage platforms.
<em>Dropbox</em> (Dropbox Inc., n.d.) was mentioned at least once by all
but one of the participants throughout the interview process. Overall,
the participants discussed the use of the following cloud storage
platforms for collaboration purposes:</p>
<ul>
<li><p><em>Dropbox</em>;</p></li>
<li><p><em>Google Drive</em> (Google LLC, 2020);</p></li>
<li><p><em>WeTransfer</em> (WeTransfer, 2021); and</p></li>
<li><p><em>iCloud</em> (Apple Inc., 2021b).</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Interestingly, cloud-based applications designed explicitly for DAW
project backup, version cataloguing and rollback and remote
collaboration, such as <em>Splice Studio</em> (Splice.com, 2022), were
not mentioned. It could well have been that the participants were
unaware of such platforms or, as seen with <em>Cloud Collaboration</em>
and <em>VST Transit</em>, their similarity to existing cloud storage
platforms precluded their adoption.</p>
<p>Figure 3 shows the range and choice of cloud storage options across
eight of the nine participants. Note that ME03 did acknowledge the ease
of file sharing today but did not mention any particular platform.</p>
<p>In addition to cloud storage, some of the participants discussed a
secondary collaboration means of communicating with clients, for
instance, a third-party videoconferencing platform:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“I’ve had situations where I’ve actually got advertising clients
overseas via Skype, dialled in listening to the voice-over session
live…. They just want to make sure that the voice-over is what they
want… and I’m just a puppet here pressing buttons.” -ME01</p>
<p>“I would chat to them, have a Zoom chat, and then just do my mixing
and send the mix back and go back-and-forth.” -ME04</p>
</blockquote>
<figure>
<img src="./media/image3.png" style="width:5.70915in;height:3.42428in"
alt="The choice of cloud storage platform(s) per participant" />
<figcaption aria-hidden="true">The choice of cloud storage platform(s)
per participant</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>Furthermore, some collaborators still prefer to use written
instructions and feedback through the exchange of emails, while others
will speak to the client directly over the phone:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“If it’s a band [I am mixing], I always say, ‘You guys discuss it as
a band, and then one person, I’ll deal with one person only, you email
me back and forth, and we can discuss whatever problems’.” -ME02</p>
<p>So, again, Dropbox is the way to go and either speak on the phone or
email for any edits.” -ME06</p>
<p>“Really, it’s just as simple as uploading the mix once I think it’s
ready and usually a phone call to the client to go over what I’ve done
and work out if there’s any changes needed.” -ME09</p>
</blockquote>
<p>However, irrespective of the chosen means, it is apparent that once
an audio mix is shared, the mixing engineer requires a reciprocal mode
of communication with the client(s) to develop the mix further and
ensure the final product meets expectations. File sharing via cloud
storage is only one part of the equation contributing to a collaborative
mixing effort.</p>
<p>One of the significant facets of the participants’ asynchronous
collaborative approach is the iterative, back-and-forth nature of their
interactions, communications, and ultimately, the audio mix development.
Some acknowledged that this methodology is not ideal; however, given the
uniform approach to remote collaboration, it appears to be accepted as
an industry-standard way of working:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“So, I’ll prepare the session once we’ve got a file that’s okay… I’ll
just send them a bounce of the… song, give them the [tempo] so they can
load it into whatever [DAW] they’re using, they record the parts from
zero, and then they send those back.” -ME01</p>
<p>“The collaboration of sending files back and forth constantly, it’s a
lot easier these days than it used to be. There used to be a time when
we would literally ‘Fed-Ex’ hard drives over to them, over ‘the pond’
because it was easier than trying to do it online.” -ME03</p>
<p>“I would chat to them, have a Zoom chat, and then just do my mixing
and send the mix back and go back-and-forth.” -ME04</p>
<p>“So… Dropbox works, but it’s a slow and a repetitious way of working,
especially when I can make… remote recordings in the studio.” -ME06</p>
</blockquote>
<h2 data-number="2.5"
id="professional-expectations-of-a-real-time-remote-collaboration-environment"><span
class="header-section-number">2.5</span> Professional Expectations of a
Real-Time Remote Collaboration Environment</h2>
<p>When asking the participants to provide a wish-list of capabilities,
features and environmental conditions of an idealised and hypothetical
real-time remote audio mixing or music production collaborative milieu,
some needed clarification to conceptualise the environment readily:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“Okay, so, like, I’m working in here on Pro Tools, and I’m connecting
to someone else at the same time? Is that what you mean? Sorry, this is
a real curveball [because] it’s something I’ve never thought about… and
correct me if I’m wrong, it’s something we’ve never been able to do,
right?” -ME05</p>
<p>“Right, so, just to be clear, you’re talking about working online
with a client, not a client working with you in the studio…. This is not
like [VST] Performer? You’re not talking about remote recording?”
-ME09</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Despite the hesitant start for some, the participants’ responses
revealed some common themes. Chief among them was the need for clear and
effective communication. Indeed, several participants articulated a
desire for an audio/visual communication link, preferring the spoken
word over a text-based chat feature:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“They have to be able to hear me the whole time. I’d love to be able
to see what’s going on… a good talkback system, real-time, and vision of
what’s going on.” -ME01</p>
<p>“I would want to have a video link, so… they can see me, and I can
see them. I’d want to have a separate audio track that’s… just a link
that I can talk to-and-fro to the client.” -ME02</p>
<p>“I want to know what the other person is doing, so I’d definitely
want to be able to see and speak to the person as we work… I’d want to
see what the other person is doing and talk through what’s happening…
like what would happen if I had that person working with me.” -ME05</p>
<p>“I think we’d both need to talk to each other as we go about working.
If we’re developing a post-production mix, let’s say, then it’s
important that we can talk through what’s needed and how to execute
those moves.” -ME09</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Similarly, some of the participants nominated a high-quality audio
monitoring capability as a critical aspect of the collaborative
environment, linking their ability to mix at an industry-standard level
of expertise with their ability to hear the mixing project in as high a
resolution as they would in a studio environment:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“I want to hear what’s going on, be able to give them directions, so
it has to be very clear. So, [a] very clear monitoring path.” -ME01</p>
<p>“I continue to monitor the mix in the studio the same way, not some
glitchy audio streamed from the other person. I want to hear the mix the
way it sounds coming straight from the DAW.” -ME05</p>
<p>“I’d want it to run like we’re both there at the mixer console
hearing the same thing as we mix…. But you’d want to hear what the other
person is doing as though you’re both in the same listening environment
and working with the highest audio resolution… as you would in your own
studio.” -ME06</p>
<p>“Okay, well, first up, I need to hear the mix in optimal conditions.”
-ME07</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Several participants not only expressed their vision of the
collaboration involving the use of a DAW platform, but they also
articulated a desire to maintain their usual degree of localised control
over that DAW’s operation. Some of the participants appeared to harbour
concern over losing creative control of the mixing project and wanted to
ensure that they could preserve a professional mixing standard:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“I’d want to keep using Pro Tools exactly the same way I use it now.
I’d want to be able to control what happens and not have someone else
make changes that I don’t know about until the session’s updated.”
-ME05</p>
<p>“The most obvious thing would be that I continue to use Cubase the
way I currently have it configured. I wouldn’t… like having to import
the stems into another type of DAW just to do the collaboration. I’d
want to make sure I’ve got control over the DAW…. I’d like to know I
still have the same level of control over the project.” -ME09</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Suppose there is a theme that eloquently encapsulates the broad
vision of the participants as a cohesive group of professional
practitioners. In that case, it is the hope for the collaborative
environment and functionality to closely resemble the experience of
being in the one studio space together:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“It’s got to be like I was sitting there in the studio… Basically,
everything that I would get by sitting there in the studio, I would want
that.” -ME01</p>
<p>“Like what would happen if I had that person working with me… in
here, in the studio.” -ME05</p>
<p>“I’d want it to run like we’re both there at the mixer console
hearing the same thing as we mix.” -ME06</p>
<p>“You’d really want it to be like you’re in the studio together.”
-ME07</p>
<p>“If I could have an environment that’s as close to the experience of
two people working in the studio together, I think that’s the best you
could wish for.” -ME09</p>
</blockquote>
<h2 data-number="2.6"
id="demand-for-multiparty-remote-collaboration"><span
class="header-section-number">2.6</span> Demand for Multiparty Remote
Collaboration</h2>
<p>The participants were not as unified in response to being asked to
provide an opinion on the apparent worth of conducting a remote
collaboration session with multiple parties as they responded to the
previous question. Two participants did recognise the value in
collaborating within a multiparty environment:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“What… often happened with me was, just purely by fact of geography,
the bands I was working with are US-based, and I was Australia-based, so
I was only over there during tours, typically. I wouldn’t be able to be
in the studio if they’re grabbing multitracks and potentially doing some
overdubs…. There were often situations where another engineer would take
over locally because they could be in the room with the band working
one-on-one. They would be listening to what I put down cause it’s live,
and they would be asking questions about how I got that, how I treated
the audience mics for the stems that I’ve sent and how I’ve got certain
sounds, how I cleaned up certain things…. It was difficult because it
always had to be done verbally; there was no easy way that I could
demonstrate it. Doing something remotely where I can… input directly
into what they’re listening to would have been huge.” -ME03</p>
<p>“Actually, thinking about it, I can see maybe in TV or film post that
would work… a professional team who know what they’re doing: the editor,
foley, sound designer. That would be good.” -ME05</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Nevertheless, the general impressions gleaned from the remaining
participants’ responses were that they either could not conceive of a
situation in their current practice when such a collaboration would be
necessary or believed a multiparty collaboration would be
unworkable:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“I’m not really sure why you’d want to [collaborate with multiple
parties] … it could get messy the more people you have moving faders and
so on.” -ME06</p>
<p>“I’ve done plenty of mixing with the band in the control room with
me, but they’re not sitting at the console moving faders with me…. I
could handle working one-on-one with someone who knows what they’re
doing, but I don’t think working in a group would be all that
productive, really.” -ME07</p>
<p>“I really don’t think that kind of thing would be necessary. I can
see the value of working with a client because that’s the kind of work I
do, but I really don’t think I’d use any kind of group collaboration.”
-ME08</p>
<p>“You’d want to make sure everyone knows what they’re doing;
otherwise, it could get really messy, really quick. I suppose there
could be a time and place for such a thing, but I think that might be
stretching the boundary a bit.” -ME09</p>
</blockquote>
<h1 data-number="3" id="discussion"><span
class="header-section-number">3</span> Discussion</h1>
<p>There are several crucial findings evident in the totality of
responses from the nine participating audio engineers:</p>
<p><strong>The DAW Platform</strong></p>
<p>While, undoubtedly, Avid’s <em>Pro Tools</em> appeared to be the most
popular platform of choice, it was by no means the only one that studios
and engineers adopted for their audio mixing activities. Indeed, when
concentrating specifically on the DAW platforms utilised in professional
audio mixing practices, the data showed that, in addition to <em>Pro
Tools</em>, Steinberg’s <em>Cubase Pro</em>, Apple’s <em>Logic Pro</em>
and MOTU’s <em>Digital Performer</em> appeared to serve the engineers’
required purposes equally as well.</p>
<p>An industry-based inquiry, conducted in 2017 by Ask.Audio, a website
resource for “digital music makers” (Sethi, 2018), reflected this
pattern of DAW use. 30, 611 survey responses determined the top-12
primary-use DAW platforms, according to the musicians and producers who
participated. The fact that a top-12 illustrates the breadth of the
global DAW market; nevertheless, the four applications with the highest
userbase were: <em>Ableton Live</em>, <em>Logic Pro</em>, <em>Pro
Tools</em> and <em>Cubase</em> (see Figure 4). This result aligned with
the interview data and pointed to a degree of commonality in utility and
capability across the most universally used DAW platforms.</p>

<figcaption aria-hidden="true">The results of Ask.Audio’s survey on the
respondents’ choice of DAW platform (Adapted from (Sethi,
2018))</figcaption>
</figure>
<p><strong>The Prevailing Use of Keyboard Shortcuts and Control
Surfaces</strong></p>
<p>The prevalence and intrinsic use of keyboard shortcuts, evidenced in
the participants’ responses, spoke to the importance of time-efficient
and expedient audio mixing processes. Similarly, the participants’
responses pointed to a current or intended addition of a control surface
to their typical DAW operation and mixing practices, again iterating the
advantages of their use.</p>
<p><strong>The Uptake of DAW-Specific Remote Collaboration
Features</strong></p>
<p>Taking an overarching view of the interview responses, the most
prominent finding was, of those participants whose chosen DAW platform
included a specific asynchronous file and project sharing capability by
way of specialised cloud storage, not one utilised this DAW-integrated
collaboration feature. However, it would be misleading to conclude that
the participants eschewed this mode of collaboration. Indeed, in most
cases, this lack of uptake is owed to the participants having already
adopted a form of asynchronous collaboration with clients that co-opts
third-party, commercial cloud storage platforms.</p>
<p>Consequently, the interview responses offered an impression that
professional studios and engineers are already engaged in remote
collaboration practices; however, the model implemented is asynchronous,
iterative and has the potential to be time-consuming and inefficient.
While some participants admitted that this practice was not an ideal use
of their time, and others remarked on the simplicity of the approach for
working with clients outside of the studio environment, only one, ME01,
described a synchronous means of remote collaboration, in this instance,
running a concurrent videoconferencing application while conducting an
in-studio voice-over session.</p>
<p><strong>Industry Expectations of Real-Time Remote Music Mixing and
Production Collaboration</strong> Asking participants to enumerate the
prominent features and capabilities a hypothetical “ideal” real-time
remote collaborative environment provided the following shortlist of
features:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><p>A clear, practical and synchronous audio/visual means of
communication, available to all collaborators throughout the
session;</p></li>
<li><p>The ability to monitor the collaboration’s mixing and production
activities in the highest fidelity possible, preferably, the exact
resolution as that typically monitored in-studio;</p></li>
<li><p>DAW-based mixing and production operations, providing control
over the changes and edits made to the DAW project; and</p></li>
<li><p>A collaborative environment and mode of operation that closely

<p><strong>The Perceived Utility of Remote Multiparty Music Mixing and
Production Collaboration</strong></p>
<p>Most of the participants’ responses did not support the need for a
multiparty capability. However, ME03 favoured a collaborative
environment inclusive of multiple parties, providing a post-live
recording scenario that would benefit from remote multiparty
collaboration. Such an instance can be considered a specialised facet of
live mix engineering, not typical of local studio-based work; therefore,
it was not necessarily surprising that some participants could not
conceive of a situation where multiparty collaboration would be
required. Indeed, some participants supposed that such collaboration
would be chaotic and not especially conducive to a cohesive
workflow.</p>
<h1 data-number="4" id="conclusion"><span
class="header-section-number">4</span> Conclusion</h1>
<p>This article presented a qualitative research study that
phenomenologically analyses the current use of DAWs, their role in audio
mixing and post-production, features used for remote collaboration and
current professional practices. After conducting semi-structured
interviews with nine Australian-based professional audio mixing
engineers, the study involved collecting, interpreting, and presenting
the data. Accordingly, the study resulted in the identification of
several significant inductive insights.</p>
<p>DAWs play an integral role in professional audio engineers work and
practice, with Pro Tools being the most popular platform. Typical DAW
use includes activities, such as studio-based audio recording,
studio-based post-production audio mixing and live multitrack audio
recording. Although audio mixing is a collaborative process, and some
DAW platforms provide native collaborative features, practitioners tend
not to use these features in typical day-to-day work. Several reasons,
including costs, such as license fees, force the participants to use a
single DAW platform by all collaborators. The availability of alternate
cost-effective cloud storage solutions (such as Dropbox) that can
provide facilities for audio file-sharing make such features redundant.
Audio mixing with remote clients by professionals typically entails
sharing audio files/recordings by an audio engineer, who mixes and
provides audio files for review and feedback. This method can be an
iterative process. Professional audio engineers did not envision a need
for multi-party remote collaboration. Instead, several participants
perceived this approach as chaotic, leading to the audio engineer losing
control of the project. When queried for an “ideal” remote collaborative
environment for audio mixing, a unique insight was that audio engineers
envision it to be an experience similar in “look and feel” to the
participants working in the “same” studio. That is, all collaborators
communicate synchronously, comparable to an in-studio experience. The
audio mixing actions of any collaborator are viewed in “real-time” by
all and played in high-resolution using the studio’s equipment. The
“virtual studio” experience in remote collaboration is similar to an
in-studio experience. Given the trend the participating engineers
suggest, any future endeavours for a remote collaborative environment
could consider achieving this goal.</p>
